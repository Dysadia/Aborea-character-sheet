# Aborea-character-sheet
# this project is about the creation of a character sheet for the platform roll20.net and the roleplay game ABOREA

# if you are coding in html and/or css:
at this time the code is a first version, which is fully functional but with high potential to grow
if you see some redundant code or possibilities for optimization pleas let me know or jump right in 
every help is appreciated

# if you have an account at roll20.net and want to use the sheet to play ABOREA at roll20.net:
the following notes are important to read to make sure that the sheet is working correctly
(in the future the following steps should not be neccessary but for now you'll need them)

# Autocalculation fields
for the autocalculation you need the autocalc.js to run (roll20 PRO user only)
if you are a no PRO user at roll20 you can set the fields that are normally calculated manually at the last red tab in the sheet by yourself
  
# Creating rollable tables 
at this time the character sheet uses for some chat outputs rollable tables (the html-code of the sheet refers to those specific tables
the sheet is working without them but you will encounter some error messages in the chat
if you want to get rid of that error messages, please send me a private message via the roll20 platform and I'll help you fix that
